# Code Review

Code review written by [Hanna Rosenberg](https://github.com/hanna-rosenberg).

1. I like your site, it’s really smart and funny. Impressive! One thing I thought about is that it would be easier to read if there were more space separating the questions. Right now it’s a bit difficult  to see what images are connected to which question. If you work more with the CSS this could be solved pretty easily. A suggestion is to put the connected images, questions and alternatives together in divs and add margin between them.
